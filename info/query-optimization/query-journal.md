# Query Optimization Journal

## Purpose
This file logs conversations that exceed 2000 tokens or could benefit from optimization. Each entry helps identify patterns and improve future query efficiency.

## Template Entry
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Query Title

**Original Query**: [User's original request]
**Token Estimate**: [Number] tokens
**Word Count**: [Number] words

**Context**: [Brief description of what was being worked on]

**Optimization Suggestions**:
1. [Specific suggestion]
2. [Another suggestion]
3. [Additional improvements]

**Improved Query Example**:
[How the query could have been more efficient]

**Lessons Learned**:
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]

**Efficiency Gain**: [Estimated token reduction percentage]

## Query Entries

<!-- New entries will be added here automatically when conversations exceed token thresholds -->

<!-- Example entry for reference:
## 2024-01-15 - Authentication System Implementation

**Original Query**: "I need help implementing authentication in my React app"
**Token Estimate**: 2500 tokens
**Word Count**: 450 words

**Context**: User wanted to add Google OAuth to portfolio website

**Optimization Suggestions**:
1. Specify exact authentication provider (Google OAuth)
2. Include current tech stack (React, Supabase)
3. Mention specific files or components to modify

**Improved Query Example**:
"Add Google OAuth authentication to React app using Supabase. Need to modify src/services/SupabaseService.ts and create ProtectedRoute component."

**Lessons Learned**:
- Technical specificity reduces token usage
- Including tech stack context upfront saves clarification rounds
- File path specification enables targeted responses

**Efficiency Gain**: ~30% token reduction

## Patterns Identified

<!-- Will be updated as patterns emerge from logged queries -->

### Common Inefficiencies
- [ ] Vague initial requests
- [ ] Missing technical context
- [ ] Broad searches instead of targeted queries

### Successful Optimizations
- [ ] Specific file path requests
- [ ] Technology-specific queries
- [ ] Incremental feature requests

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor conversations for token usage
- [ ] Log queries exceeding 2000 tokens
- [ ] Review entries monthly for patterns
- [ ] Update optimization guidelines based on findings
