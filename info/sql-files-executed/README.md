# Executed SQL Files Archive

This directory contains SQL files that have been successfully executed against the database, along with their execution logs and results.

## Purpose

This archive serves as:
- **Historical Record**: Complete log of all database changes
- **Rollback Reference**: Source files for potential rollback operations  
- **Audit Trail**: Documentation for compliance and debugging
- **Knowledge Base**: Reference for future similar operations

### File Naming Convention
```
[original_name]_executed_[timestamp].sql
[original_name]_log_[timestamp].txt
[original_name]_rollback_[timestamp].sql

Example:
- user_profiles_schema_executed_2024_08_29_14_30_00.sql
- user_profiles_schema_log_2024_08_29_14_30_00.txt
- user_profiles_schema_rollback_2024_08_29_14_30_00.sql
```

## Execution Documentation

### Log File Contents
Each execution log includes:
```
=== SQL Execution Log ===
File: [original filename]
Executed: [timestamp]
Environment: [development/staging/production]
Executed By: [person/system]
Duration: [execution time]

=== Pre-Execution State ===
[relevant database state before execution]

=== Execution Results ===
[query results, affected rows, etc.]

=== Post-Execution Verification ===
[verification steps and results]

=== Issues/Notes ===
[any problems encountered or important notes]
```

### Rollback Documentation
Each rollback script includes:
- **Reverse Operations**: SQL to undo the changes
- **Data Restoration**: Commands to restore affected data
- **Verification Steps**: How to confirm rollback success
- **Dependencies**: Other operations that might be affected

## Current Archive Status

### Recent Executions
*No executions recorded yet*

### Monthly Summary
- **August 2024**: 0 executions
- **Total Files Archived**: 0
- **Average Execution Time**: N/A
- **Success Rate**: N/A

## Search and Retrieval

### Finding Executed Files
```bash
# Search by filename
find . -name "*user_profiles*"

# Search by execution date
find . -name "*2024_08_29*"

# Search by category
find . -name "*schema*"
```

### Index Usage
The `archive_index.md` file provides:
- Chronological listing of all executions
- Categorized index by operation type
- Quick reference for rollback procedures
- Performance and impact summaries

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
1. **Identify Target**: Locate the executed file and its rollback script
2. **Verify Rollback**: Review rollback script for accuracy
3. **Create Backup**: Backup current database state
4. **Execute Rollback**: Run the rollback script
5. **Verify Results**: Confirm rollback was successful
6. **Document Action**: Log the rollback operation

### Partial Rollback
For complex operations that may need partial rollback:
- Individual statement rollbacks available
- Data-only rollbacks (preserve schema changes)
- Schema-only rollbacks (preserve data changes)

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Requirements
This archive supports:
- **Change Tracking**: Complete history of database modifications
- **Compliance Reporting**: Required documentation for regulations
- **Security Audits**: Access to all security-related changes
- **Performance Analysis**: Historical performance impact data

### Data Retention
- **Active Period**: 2 years of immediate access
- **Archive Period**: 5 years in compressed storage
- **Permanent Records**: Critical schema changes and security updates
- **Purge Policy**: Non-critical development changes after 2 years

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Automated Archiving
When SQL files are executed:
1. **Pre-execution**: Validation and backup
2. **Execution**: Run with comprehensive logging
3. **Post-execution**: Results verification
4. **Archiving**: Automatic move to this directory
5. **Indexing**: Update master index and documentation

### Development Environment
- Development executions clearly marked
- Separate from production operations
- Enhanced debugging information included
- Faster rollback procedures for testing

## Maintenance and Cleanup

### Regular Maintenance
- **Monthly**: Verify archive integrity and completeness
- **Quarterly**: Compress older files and update indexes
- **Annually**: Review retention policy and archive to long-term storage
- **As Needed**: Emergency recovery and rollback support

### Archive Health
- File integrity checks
- Index accuracy verification
- Rollback script validation
- Performance impact analysis

## Best Practices

### Before Archiving
- Verify execution was successful
- Confirm all required logs are present
- Test rollback procedures
- Update relevant documentation

### Archive Management
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include comprehensive execution logs
- Maintain accurate index information
- Regular backup of archive directory

### Access Control
- Restricted access to production archives
- Read-only permissions for historical data
- Audit logging for archive access
- Secure storage for sensitive operations
