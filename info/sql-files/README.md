# SQL Files Repository

This directory contains SQL files that are ready for execution or are currently being prepared for database implementation.

## Purpose

This folder serves as a staging area for:
- SQL scripts awaiting execution
- New database features in development
- Experimental queries and procedures
- Backup copies of important SQL operations

## File Status

### Staging Files
Files in this directory are:
- ‚úÖ **Syntax Verified**: All SQL syntax has been validated
- ‚è≥ **Awaiting Execution**: Ready to be run against the database
- üìù **Under Review**: Pending approval before execution
- üîÑ **In Development**: Being actively worked on

## Organization

### File Naming Convention
```
[priority]_[category]_[description]_[date].sql

Examples:
- 001_schema_user_profiles_2024_08_29.sql
- 002_policies_authentication_rls_2024_08_29.sql
- 003_functions_profile_management_2024_08_29.sql
```

### Categories
- **schema**: Database table and structure definitions
- **policies**: Row Level Security and access control
- **functions**: Stored procedures and database functions
- **indexes**: Performance optimization indexes
- **migrations**: Schema evolution and data migration
- **maintenance**: Database cleanup and optimization

## Execution Workflow

### Pre-Execution Checklist
- [ ] Syntax validation completed
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Testing completed in development environment
- [ ] Peer review completed (if required)

### Execution Process
1. **Backup Current State**: Create database backup if needed
2. **Execute Script**: Run SQL in appropriate environment
3. **Verify Results**: Confirm expected changes were made
4. **Move to Executed**: Transfer file to `sql-files-executed/`
5. **Update Documentation**: Record execution details

### Post-Execution
- File moved to `sql-files-executed/` with timestamp
- Execution log created with results
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Current Status

### Files Ready for Execution
*No files currently staged*

### Files Under Development

### Supabase Integration
Files in this directory are prepared for:
- Supabase SQL Editor execution
- Database migration workflows
- Development environment testing
- Production deployment procedures

## Best Practices

### Before Adding Files
1. **Validate Syntax**: Use PostgreSQL validator
2. **Test Locally**: Run in development environment
3. **Document Purpose**: Include clear comments and description
4. **Define Dependencies**: List any required prerequisites

### File Preparation
- Include descriptive header comments
- Add creation date and author information
- Document expected results
- Include rollback procedures when applicable

### Quality Assurance
- Peer review for complex changes
- Performance impact assessment
- Security review for policy changes
- Integration testing with application code

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly review of staged files
- Monthly cleanup of old development files
- Quarterly optimization of executed operations
- Annual archive of historical SQL files

### Performance Tracking
- Execution time monitoring
- Impact assessment on application performance
- Resource usage analysis
- Error rate tracking
