> i can see a lot of policies, the policy in focus is "Admins can view 
  all profiles". i can see that policy

ΓùÅ Perfect! You found the problematic policy. Let me mark our first
  todo as completed and continue with the step-by-step fix.

ΓùÅ Great! Now let's Step 2: Delete the problematic policy

  The "Admins can view all profiles" policy is causing the infinite
  recursion. Here's what you need to do:

  1. Click on the "Admins can view all profiles" policy to
  select/highlight it
  2. Look for a Delete button (usually a trash can icon or "Delete"
  button)
  3. Delete this policy - Don't worry, we'll replace it with a better
   solution

  Before you delete it, can you show me the exact SQL content of this
   policy? I want to confirm it matches what we identified as the
  problem:

  EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role = 'admin'
  )

  Once you confirm the SQL and delete this policy, the infinite
  recursion should immediately stop, and your API calls should start
  working again (though admin users won't have special access until
  we create the replacement).

  Question: Can you see the full SQL of this policy, and are you 
  ready to delete it?

> where do i run this sql? i ran it in sql editor and it gave me an 
  error - syntax error near EXISTS

ΓùÅ No, don't run that SQL! That was just for you to look at and
  compare.

  Let me clarify - you're still in the Supabase dashboard policies
  section, right?

  What you need to do:

  1. Click on the "Admins can view all profiles" policy in the
  policies list
  2. Look at its content/SQL (there should be a way to view or edit
  it)
  3. Tell me what SQL you see - just copy and paste it here so I can
  confirm it's the right policy
  4. Then delete that policy using the delete button in the dashboard

  Don't run any SQL commands yet - we're working purely in the
  dashboard interface for now.

  The SQL I showed you (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles...)) was just
  the pattern I expected to see inside that policy's definition.

  Can you:
  1. Click on the "Admins can view all profiles" policy
  2. Show me what SQL content you see for that policy
  3. Look for a Delete button for that specific policy

  You should be able to view and delete policies directly in the
  dashboard without using the SQL editor.

> (EXISTS ( SELECT 1
     FROM profiles p
    WHERE ((p.user_id = auth.uid()) AND (p.role = 'admin'::text))))\
  \
  this is the sql that it contains

ΓùÅ Perfect! That's exactly the problematic policy causing the infinite
   recursion. Notice how it's checking the profiles table FROM WITHIN
   a policy ON the profiles table - that's what creates the infinite
  loop.

ΓùÅ Now DELETE this policy:

  1. Look for a Delete button (trash icon) for this policy
  2. Click Delete and confirm the deletion

  Once you delete it, the infinite recursion will stop and your API
  calls should work again.

  Step 3: Create the replacement function

  After you delete the policy, we need to go to the SQL Editor and
  create a special function that can check admin status without
  recursion:

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin_user(check_user_id UUID DEFAULT
   auth.uid())
  RETURNS BOOLEAN
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  SECURITY DEFINER
  STABLE
  AS $$
  DECLARE
      user_role TEXT;
  BEGIN
      SELECT role INTO user_role
      FROM profiles
      WHERE id = check_user_id;

      RETURN COALESCE(user_role = 'admin', false);
  EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
          RETURN false;
  END;
  $$;

  First, please delete the policy, then let me know when you're ready
   for the SQL Editor step.
